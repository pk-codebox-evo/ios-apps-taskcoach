--- Prerequisites ---------------------------------------------------

You need Python version 2.5 or higher and wxPython version 
2.8.6.0-unicode or higher. See http://www.taskcoach.org/devinfo.html 
for more details and platform specific notes. 
    
For building distributions and running tests, GNU make is used. Make 
is installed on most systems by default. On Windows you can install 
Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com) to get make and a lot of other nice 
utilities. Make will automatically use the file Makefile as its 
script, unless directed otherwise. Makefile in turn uses "make.py" 
to build distributions. So, if you don't have make installed you can
still build the distributions by running the commands from the 
Makefile by hand.

--- Preparation -----------------------------------------------------

Task Coach needs a few generated files, run the following command
to generate them:

  make prepare

--- Running ---------------------------------------------------------

Start Task Coach from the command line like this:

  python taskcoach.py

--- Testing ---------------------------------------------------------

To run the tests, enter:

  make unittests

Check out the Makefile for more testing options. The test script
has a bunch of options as well, enter: 

  cd tests; python test.py --help

for more information.

--- Test coverage ---------------------------------------------------

To create test coverage reports, you need to install coverage.py
(http://pypi.python.org/pypi/coverage/). Install with:

  sudo easy_install coverage

To create a coverage report, enter:

  make coverage

The coverage report is written to tests/coverage.out.

--- Building distributions ------------------------------------------

Use the Makefile to create distributions (they are placed in dist/):

  make windist # Creates installer for Windows
  make dmg     # Creates disk image for Mac OS X
  make rpm     # Creates generic RPM
  make fedora  # Creates RPM for Fedora 8 or later
  make deb     # Creates Debian package for Debian and Ubuntu

Check out the Makefile for more details. E.g. to create the Task
Coach app on Mac OS X you can also run:

  python make.py py2app

The TaskCoach.app ends up in build/

--- Installation ----------------------------------------------------

There are two options to install Task Coach: 

First, you can simply move this directory to some suitable 
location and run taskcoach.py (or taskcoach.pyw if you are on 
the Windows platform) from there.

Alternatively, you can use the Python distutils setup script
to let Python install Task Coach for you. In that case run the
following command:

  python setup.py install

You may need to run this command as root if you get 
"Permission denied" errors:

  sudo python setup.py install

If you have a previous version of Task Coach installed, you may
need to force old files to be overwritten, like this:

  python setup.py install --force
