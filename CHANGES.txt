Release 0.31 - April ?, 2005

Note:
- Task Coach migrated to Python 2.4.1 and wxPython 2.5.5.1. Added
  check to give friendly message if wxPython version is below the
  required version number.

Bugs fixed:
- A unittest.py bug that was fixed in Python 2.4 revealed a
  bug in test.py (1181714)
- When searching for a task that is completed, while the 
  'show completed' switch is off, the search shows the path to 
  the task (i.e. parent tasks), but not the matched task itself 
  (1182528).
- When searching for tasks in the tree view, composite tasks 
  are expanded automatically to show the children that match
  the search string (1182528).
- Columns were hidden by setting their width to 0, but that didnot
  make them entirely invisible on some Linux platforms (1152566). 

Features added:
- In the task list and effort list the task column is automatically
  resized to take up the available space.
- Added columns to the task list view for: budget, total budget,
  budget left, and total budget left.
- Reorganized view menu, added extra task filters, added menu item to
  reset filters (1181762).


Release 0.30 - April 11, 2005

Bugs fixed:
- More than one task due today would crash Task Coach (1180641).



Release 0.29 - April 10, 2005

Bugs fixed:
- New effort in the context menu did not work in release 0.28 
  (1178562).
- When selecting 'View' -> 'Completed tasks' in the task tree, only
  completed root tasks were hidden (1179372).
  
Features added:
- What tab is active is now a persistent setting. This includes the tabs 
  and choices in the mainwindow and the effort choices in the task editor
  (1178779).
- Reordered 'View' -> 'Tasks due before end of' menu (1178880).
- Added a separate 'Budget' tab in the task editor.
- Taskbar icon now indicates whether task effort tracking is on (1178057).
- Effort is sorted from most recent to least recent (1179332).
- Changed task/subtask separator in the task list view from '|' to ' -> '
  (1179374).



Release 0.28 - April 6, 2005

Bugs fixed:
- Hitting return or double click to edit effort in the task editor 
  now works (1172164).
- Subtasks with the same name would only be visible once in the task tree
  view.

Features added:
- You can hide composite tasks in the task list view so that only leaf
  tasks are visible. Menu item 'View' -> 'Tasks with subtasks'. Requested 
  by Brian Crounse.



Release 0.27 - April 4, 2005

Features added:
- Tasks can have a budget.



Release 0.26 - March 28, 2005

Bugs fixed:
- Marking a task completed did not stop effort tracking (1159918).
- Reading lots of efforts was slow.

Features added:
- Save button is disabled when saving is not necessary, requested by Mike
  Vorozhbensky (1164472).
- Effort records have a description field, requested by Kent (1167147).



Release 0.25 - March 13, 2005 

Bugs fixed:
- The menu item 'Effort' -> 'New effort' did not work in release 0.24.

Features added:
- XML export now includes effort records.
- Effort per day, per week and per month view now also show total time 
  spent (i.e. time including time spent on subtasks). 



Release 0.24 - March 10, 2005

Bugs fixed:
- Saving a selection of tasks to a separate file would also save all effort 
  records to that file (instead of just the effort records for the selected 
  tasks), giving errors when loading that file.
- Deleting a task with effort records would not delete the effort
  records.

Features added:
- The tracking status of tasks is saved. So if you start tracking a
  task, quit Task Coach, and restart Task Coach later, effort for that 
  task is still being tracked. Requested by Bob Hossley.



Release 0.23 - February 20, 2005

Bugs fixed:
- Fixed a couple of bugs in the unit tests, discovered by Stephen Boulet
  and Jerome Laheurte on the Linux platform.



Release 0.22 - February 17, 2005

Bugs fixed:
- In the effort summary view, effort spent on a task in the same month
  or week but in different years would erroneously be added. 
  E.g. effort in January 2004 and January 2006 would be added. 
- The mechanism to prevent effort periods with a negative duration (i.e.
  a start time later than the stop time) in the effort editor was
  invoked on each key stroke which caused inconvenient behaviour. Fixed
  it by only invoking it when the user leaves the text or combo box.

Features added:
- Added possibility to start tracking effort for a task, with start time
  equal to the end time of the previous effort period. This is for
  example convenient if you stop working on a task and then spend
  some time deciding on what to do next. This is the 'Start tracking 
  from last stop time' menu item in the 'Effort' menu.
- (Re)Added the unittests to the source distribution. See INSTALL.txt.
- Export to XML. Currently limited to tasks, effort is not exported yet.



Release 0.21 - February 9, 2005

Bugs fixed:
- Setting the start date/time in the effort editor would change the stop
  date/time while not strictly necessary to prevent negative durations.
- Refreshing the virtual ListCtrl failed under 
  wxPython2.5-gtk2-unicode-2.5.3.1-fc2_py2.3 and 
  wxPython-common-gtk2-unicode-2.5.3.1-fc2_py2.3. Reported by Stephen
  Boulet. 
- After iconizing the main window for a second time, the icon in the
  task bar wouldn't be hidden anymore. Reported and fixed by Jerome
  Laheurte.



Release 0.20 - February 6, 2005

Bugs fixed:
- Reading .tsk files version 2 failed.
- Completed child tasks were not hidden in the tree view when
  'View->Completed tasks' was on.
- Hiding the find panel did not clear the search filter.
- When searching for tasks, not all matches were shown in the tree view.
- Displaying time spent and total time spent in the list view for more
  than a dozen tasks and efforts was slow. Used caching to speed it up.
- Tool tips on the toolbar included mnemonics and accelerator characters
  on Linux. Reported on python-2.3.4 and 
  wxPython2.5-gtk2-unicode-2.5.3.1-fc2_py2.3 on Suse 9.2 by Stephen
  Boulet.

Features added:
- Effort can be viewed summarized per day, per week, and per month.
- Effort for a specific task can be viewed (and edited) in the task editor.
- Effort tracking can be stopped from the taskbar menu.
- Size and position of the main window are saved in the settings and 
  restored on the next session. This also includes whether the main window 
  is iconized or not.
- Splash screen can be turned off.
